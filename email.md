Subject: Discussing Integration Requirements for the Mobile Fin-Tech Project

Hi Joe,

I'm reaching out to discuss some crucial aspects of our integration with your mobile fin-tech product.

Firstly, we need to clarify the nature of your transaction flows. Could you provide details on:

Transaction Flows: How many types of transaction flows are there in your system? Understanding this will help us tailor our integration more effectively.

Volume and Velocity: What is the expected volume and frequency of these transactions? This information is crucial to decide between a real-time streaming endpoint and a nightly batch upload. While streaming ensures immediacy, it requires significant resources on both ends. On the other hand, batch uploads, are less resource-intensive but offer less immediacy.

Schema Requirements: Are the transactions uniform enough to be captured under a single schema, or do their variations require multiple schemas? This will help us in defining the complexity and scope of our integration.

Infrastructure Planning: Given the dynamic nature of fintech projects, could you provide your anticipated growth rates? We understand the tendency for optimism in such forecasts, but a realistic projection will help us balance infrastructure provisioning, avoiding both over and under-capacity scenarios.

We are mindful of the current budget constraints and the project's status. Our goal is to offer a solution that is economically viable without compromising future scalability and performance. Your insights on these points will be instrumental in creating a tailored and efficient integration strategy.

We appreciate your cooperation in providing this information.
